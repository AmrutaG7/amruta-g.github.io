## 💡 About Me

Versatile and detail-driven Business Data Analyst with over 5 years of experience delivering actionable insights across banking, healthcare, and supply chain domains. Proficient in SQL, Python, Tableau, and cloud platforms like Snowflake. Adept at translating raw data into strategic recommendations through data storytelling, interactive dashboards, and cross-functional collaboration.

With a strong foundation in business analytics, I focus on generating insights that drive informed decision-making and support both reporting and stakeholder engagement.
