## 💡 About Me

Versatile and detail-driven Business Data Analyst with over 5 years of experience delivering actionable insights across banking, healthcare, and supply chain domains. Proficient in SQL, Python, Tableau, and cloud platforms like Snowflake. Adept at translating raw data into strategic recommendations through data storytelling, interactive dashboards, and cross-functional collaboration.

With a strong foundation in business analytics, I focus on generating insights that drive informed decision-making and support both reporting and stakeholder engagement. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between technical data analysis and business strategy to create scalable, impact-driven solutions.

**Professional Experience:**  
At USAA, as part of the data strategy team, I support omni-channel marketing initiatives for banking products such as credit cards and deposits. I collaborate closely with analytics and engineering teams to support campaign performance measurement, audience segmentation, and data flow optimization across multiple channels. My experience enables me to act as a bridge between data analytics, business stakeholders, and engineering teams to drive data-informed decisions at scale.
